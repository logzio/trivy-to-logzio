# Trivy to Logzio

This project allows sending [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy-operator) vulnerability reports from your K8S cluster to Logz.io.  

To use it, see Logz.io's [logzio-trivy Helm Chart](https://github.com/logzio/logzio-helm/tree/master/charts/logzio-trivy).

## Changelog:

  - **Breaking changes**:
    - Script will run always.
    - Scanning for reports will occur once upon script start, then once a day at the scheduled time.
